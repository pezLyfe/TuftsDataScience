The Data Deluge:
-	“All models are wrong, but some are useful”
-	View data mathematically and create a story  for it later
  - "Google used analytical tools and better data to reach the top of their competitors"
  - "We don't know why this page is better than that one, but the data says it's true"
    - Once a metric is created, assume it's being gamed (original)
   - Who knows why people do what they do? They do it, and we can measure it
   - Adovcating for obsoletion of the scientific method
   - Petabytes say "Correlation is enough"
    - Maybe for most cases, but what's the cost of getting it wrong?
      - Can it be more damaging to get it wrong than getting it right most of the time?
      - "Doesn't know what they look like or how they live, but the genome is different
      so it must be a new species"
        - Why is that important? 
      - Correlation supercedes causation, science can advance without coherent models
  - Some things are beyond the capability of people to understand
    - Being able to describe them and discuss may be a good approximation
    - But what's useful coming out of it? Why is it important
    
A/B Testing:
- "I am a believer in reason and facts and evidence and science and feedback"
- Double blind study, with populations being shown two different things
  - Behavior is compared against certain metrics
    - Again with the gaming of metrics
    - Temporary versus sustainable advantage,IS THIS USEFUL AGAINST A LONGER TERM PLAN????
    - Flying blind based on reactionary decisions
    - Hyperpersonalization and it's advantages
  - Choosing carefully the metrics which define the success of a choice
    - If more people interacted, but your message was diluted, is this still a win?
    - GoFundMe example is a good example of it working
      - More money raised 
    - Highest paid person makes the call (Hippos)
      - Experienced similar in my career
      - Objective facts backing up a decision or proposal from a younger employee
        - Aside from raw numbers, what else is the decision based on? 
      - Experimentation is good, but some higher level conclusions should be drawn
    - Risks in a mistake, risks in tiny improvements
      - A/B reduced the number of big, dramatic changes to products
      - Wholesale revisions have become too risky
      - Risks of plodding incrementalism
        - Leaving susceptible to takeover from a better competitor
      - The psychology behind small wins
        - gamification, constant feedback, and lack of big motivations
        - "Disruptive innovation" 
    - Number 4 Experience teaches lessons, data can make the idea of lessons obsolete
      - "Web businesses have products too dynamic to sit still for days or weeks"
      - "Big data is not enough, we need real-time data that we can act on during the course of a day"
        - No time to learn and apply lessons, no lessons no rules to extract
          - A/B to guide them, no need to worry about why users behaved in certain ways
          - Automated changeovers of traffic to the better performing option
          - Most important decisions are immune to focus-grouping, let alone A/B testing
            - "Not the consumers job to know what they want"
              - Pushing all decisions to software misses out on the big opportunities
              - Refining over creating
              - '3, 4, or 5 pixels wide for border, make your case?'
                - Ultimately, who cares? Is that important in the end?
           - Safety, confidence in decision making
            - Atrophying of decision and planning
  
"Towards a more useful definition of Data Science"
- Missed the swine flu pandemic in 2009, underestimated, overestimated in 2013 by 50%
  - Actually over estimated prevalence 100 out of 108 weeks since August
  - Projecting two week lag of CDC data would perform just as well
    - Search terms from the published paper didn't line up with GFT results or the CDC data
  - "Big Data studies" difference between big data and previous data sets
    - collected through observation, without prior design
    - for a purpose other than the study (adapted)
    - Merged, making the lack of definition worse
    - No controls on the data
    - "seemingly complete" assuming perfect information is not the same as having complete information
    - A size based defination of big data is unreasonable
      - Computing power makes larger files easier as it improves
   - GFT
    - Overpredicted by quite a bit, underpredicted by quite a bit
      - Does knowledge of the model change the model? 
      - Difficulties in accounting for changes in behavior?
    - Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
      - Overhyped and how it's presented

 Numbers Rule your World Chapters 2,3
 - Modelers make general statements about the world at large from snapshots of data
  - Two ways to tell the spinach story
    - Triumph of the agency for a speedy response
    - Criticizing that the spinach was likely gone by the time it was pinpointed
      - Damage done to the spinach industry
      - Second narrative is closer to the real truth
  - Bills restricting credit scoring
    - Credit scoring as redlining, and irresponsibly overcharing insurance premiums
    - Supporters praise efficiency, reduced borrowing costs
  - How long to wait before declaring an outbreak?
    - CDC declared late in 2006 (close to the peak)
    - But correctly identified no outbreak in 2005 and 2004
    - Early in the investigation is difficult to call due to lack of information
    - Shotgun approach yielded the spinach conclusion
    - The cost of wrong predictions
      - Severe loss to spinach industry
      - Increased illness and loss of lives
  - Broad street pump
    - Launch of epidemiology
      - Epidemiology intelligence services
  - Consumer warning for all spinach
    - Tracking down the source while cases continued to rise
    - Finding the batch code on the offending bags
    - Matched to tainted river water and animal feces
 - We don't know how many cases if any were avoided due to the recall
  - Drawing attention may have prevented further contamination
  - But, spinach sales dropped incredibly
    - Further effects on other bagged salads
    - Innocent farms roped into the same category
  - The difficulty is in connecting correlations to the cause
    - People got sick, people ate spinach, therefore spinach made them sick
    - One truth, but many many wrong answers
    - Epidemiologists look beyond statistics only to find corroborative evidence
    - Educated guesses, lab work work together to test theories
 - Combined tools and evidence from across the country
  - Bringing new connections that weren't possible before
  - Problems with less common foods are easier to catch than common foods
    - Comparing the rate of spinach consumption statewide to the 80% of cases that ate
 - Hill's nine viewpoints
  - 6 of 9 in the spinach case
  - "Impossible to capture the truth, but creating useful models for understanding
  and controlling disease is the goal"
- Credit modelers have much lower stakes than epidemiologists
  - However their work is scrutinized heavily by the same people that embrace epi
  - "The miracle of instant credit"
    - Some borrowers pose more risks than others
    - Credit modelers allow them to differentiate
    - High scrutiny yields tight credit which yields slow growth
    - FICO as the first statistical model for credit
    - Make more nuanced comparisons of customers
    - Consistency across the population
 - Consumer spending accounts for 2/3 of the US economy
  - Default rates are much, much lower when compared with traditional scoring methods
  - Gave lower incomes access to credit
    - Is this inherently good? 
  - Credit scores as proxy to insurance claim risk
