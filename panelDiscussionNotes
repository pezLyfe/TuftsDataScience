The Data Deluge:
-	“All models are wrong, but some are useful”
-	View data mathematically and create a story  for it later
  - "Google used analytical tools and better data to reach the top of their competitors"
  - "We don't know why this page is better than that one, but the data says it's true"
    - Once a metric is created, assume it's being gamed (original)
   - Who knows why people do what they do? They do it, and we can measure it
   - Adovcating for obsoletion of the scientific method
   - Petabytes say "Correlation is enough"
    - Maybe for most cases, but what's the cost of getting it wrong?
      - Can it be more damaging to get it wrong than getting it right most of the time?
      - "Doesn't know what they look like or how they live, but the genome is different
      so it must be a new species"
        - Why is that important? 
      - Correlation supercedes causation, science can advance without coherent models
  - Some things are beyond the capability of people to understand
    - Being able to describe them and discuss may be a good approximation
    - But what's useful coming out of it? Why is it important
    
A/B Testing:
- "I am a believer in reason and facts and evidence and science and feedback"
- Double blind study, with populations being shown two different things
  - Behavior is compared against certain metrics
    - Again with the gaming of metrics
    - Temporary versus sustainable advantage,IS THIS USEFUL AGAINST A LONGER TERM PLAN????
    - Flying blind based on reactionary decisions
    - Hyperpersonalization and it's advantages
  - Choosing carefully the metrics which define the success of a choice
    - If more people interacted, but your message was diluted, is this still a win?
    - GoFundMe example is a good example of it working
      - More money raised 
    - Highest paid person makes the call (Hippos)
      - Experienced similar in my career
      - Objective facts backing up a decision or proposal from a younger employee
        - Aside from raw numbers, what else is the decision based on? 
      - Experimentation is good, but some higher level conclusions should be drawn
    - Risks in a mistake, risks in tiny improvements
      - A/B reduced the number of big, dramatic changes to products
      - Wholesale revisions have become too risky
      - Risks of plodding incrementalism
        - Leaving susceptible to takeover from a better competitor
      - The psychology behind small wins
        - gamification, constant feedback, and lack of big motivations
        - "Disruptive innovation" 
    - Number 4 Experience teaches lessons, data can make the idea of lessons obsolete
      -
