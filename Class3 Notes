"Big Data"
- volume, velocity, and variety
- Observational, not controlled, complete (seemingly), adapted, merged
  - Observed rather than measured (don't control the source of the data), adapted from other use cases, merged with unrelated               data sets
  - Observational doesn't directly control for bias, or sampling error, can't understand who is responding and who is not
    - Non-response bias
  - Lack of control (Numbers are typically in reference to something else in normal statistics)
    - 3.5 GPA with a population average of 3.2
    - Hans Roessling statistics Youtube presenter
      - Big Data is a pile of numerators with no denominators
      - Web clicks knows how many people did click, but not how many people did not
  - Complete, seemingly
    - Claim of complete information (Still don't know what you don't have)
    - "Surveillance gym" - Not collecting data from people who haven't come
  - Adapted
    - Repurposing data for something other than its original use
    - Difficulties in understanding when the original author is unreachable
  - Merged
    - Merging data taken from multiple locations
    - Yields errors, duplicates, quality problems
    
 MSC Book
  - Discard old data practices
    - N = all replace random samples
    - Embrace messy data, sacrifice exactitude
    - No need to understand why, rely on correlation
  Fung
    - Variations around the average (difference from average is most interesting)
    - Why models make mistakes and why use them
    - How many averages (sub groups of the population, how much aggregation is required?)
    - Different types of errors 
    - Arguing the impossible
    
 A/B Testing
  - subjective decisions become incontrevertible matters of data science
  - We don't know why one choice is better, it just is
  
Massive amounts of data and applied math replace every other tool that has ever been invented
  - With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves
    - Is it horseshit?
